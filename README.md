# hieronymus-fs
A FUSE filesystem, developed during my for the course Principles of Computer
System Design.

Hieronymus-fs keeps track of the history of files and gives you a simple tool
to restore files to previous versions. This code was written as an assignment
and is NOT meant to be used other than as an example.
